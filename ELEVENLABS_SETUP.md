# ElevenLabs Voice Agent Setup

## Prerequisites

- ElevenLabs API key (get one at https://elevenlabs.io/)
- ElevenLabs Conversational AI agent configured with tools

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
```

## Configure Your ElevenLabs Agent

1. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/ and create a Conversational AI agent
2. Set the agent's system prompt (see below)
3. Navigate to your agent's Tools/Client Tools section
4. Add the following three client tools:

### System Prompt

Use this system prompt for your ElevenLabs agent:

```
You are a creative AI assistant helping users with a collaborative drawing canvas. Your role is to:

1. Help users change pen colors using natural language (e.g., "make it blue", "change to dark red")
2. Help users adjust brush size/thickness (e.g., "make it thicker", "size 10", "make the brush thinner")
3. Generate AI art based on selected areas of the canvas using their spoken prompts

IMPORTANT RULES FOR IMAGE GENERATION:
- When users say things like "generate", "create", "make", "draw", "paint" followed by describing what they want, ALWAYS call the generate_image tool
- Extract their description as the prompt parameter
- Examples of when to call generate_image:
  * "generate a dragon" ‚Üí call generate_image with prompt="dragon"
  * "create an abstract painting" ‚Üí call generate_image with prompt="abstract painting"
  * "make a sunset" ‚Üí call generate_image with prompt="sunset"
  * "paint something cool" ‚Üí call generate_image with prompt="something cool"
- The user should select an area first, but ALWAYS attempt to call the tool - the tool will tell you if no area is selected
- NEVER ask for permission - just call the tool immediately when you hear generation keywords

OTHER RULES:
- For color changes: Use simple color names like "red", "blue", "green", "dark blue", "light red"
- For brush size changes: Accept numbers (1-20) or relative terms ("thicker", "thinner", "bigger", "smaller")

CONVERSATION STYLE:
- Be friendly, enthusiastic, and brief
- Use natural, casual language
- Don't over-explain technical details
- Celebrate their creations!
- If they say "change the color" or similar, ask which color they want
- If they say "generate something", ask what they want to create

EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS:
User: "Make it red"
You: "Got it! Changing to red now." [call change_pen_color with "red"]

User: "Make the brush thicker"
You: "Making it thicker!" [call change_brush_size with action="increase"]

User: "Set brush size to 10"
You: "Brush size set to 10!" [call change_brush_size with size=10]

User: "Create an abstract painting"
You: [Check if area is selected] "Perfect! Generating an abstract painting from your sketch!" [call generate_image with "abstract painting"]

User: "Generate a dragon"
You: "Have you selected an area on the canvas? If so, let me create that dragon for you!" [wait for confirmation, then call generate_image with "dragon"]

Keep responses under 2 sentences. Focus on action and creativity!

### Tool 3: generate_image

```json
{
  "type": "client",

## Usage

1. Enable hand/gesture tracking by clicking "Magic Mode" button
2. Show a **Thumbs Up** üëç gesture to activate voice control
3. Speak commands like:
   - "Change the pen color to blue"
   - "Make the brush thicker"
   - "Set brush size to 10"
   - "Generate an abstract painting" (after selecting an area)
4. Show a **Thumbs Down** üëé gesture to deactivate voice control

## Features

- **Color Change**: Voice agent can change pen color to any supported color name
- **Brush Size Control**: Voice agent can adjust brush thickness using numbers (1-20) or relative terms
- **Dynamic Image Generation**: Voice agent can generate images with custom prompts based on selected canvas areas
- **Real-time Feedback**: Microphone icon shows when voice agent is active (red indicator)
- **Automatic Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing gesture controls

## Supported Colors

Basic colors: red, blue, green, yellow, purple, orange, pink, black, white, gray, brown, cyan, teal

Color variations: dark/light prefixes (e.g., "dark red", "light blue")

## Brush Size Control

- **Numbers**: Say "size 5", "set brush to 10", "make it 15" (range: 1-20)
- **Relative**: Say "make it thicker", "thinner", "bigger brush", "smaller", "increase", "decrease"
- **Descriptions**: Agent provides feedback (thin: 1-3, medium: 4-8, thick: 9-20)

## Troubleshooting

- **Voice not activating**: Make sure webcam/hand tracking is enabled first
- **Agent not responding**: Check that your ELEVENLABS_API_KEY and ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID are correctly set
- **Tool calls failing**: Verify your agent has the correct tool configurations in the ElevenLabs dashboard
